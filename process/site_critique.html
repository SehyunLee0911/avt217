	<h4>Navigation</h4>
	<p>Personally I think it has a very good navigation system. Buttons have a nice allignment also having the exact information. Great platform for both PC and mobile.</p>
		
	<h4>Usability</h4>
	<p>Any user can use this site without strugling to find buttons and read the explanation for any contents. Does not have long loading terms with clear interfaces.</p>
	
	<h4>Typography and hierarchy</h4>
	<p>Typography is great, using specific fonts for specific information, has different color of fonts to distinguish information. Ex) "Buy Tickets", "Appearing Tonight", and description of the artist's show.</p>
	
	<h4>Overall style/look and feel</h4>
	<p>Personally I would say it fits well on a Jazz Club, because it looks fancy and simple at the same time with restricted fonts and colors, that makes the mood.</p>
